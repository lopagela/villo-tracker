# Track Brussels' Villo

Villo is a bike sharing system in Brussels, Belgium.
This project tracks the availability of bikes and parking spots at Villo stations,
at the bike level.

Villo is a service managed by the company JCDecaux, so, this project can 
easily be re-used for other cities, such as Lyon, Marseille, etc.
